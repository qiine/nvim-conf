# My fancy config:

Surely overcomplicated

Absolutely not finished

Extremely heretical ;p

My text editor journey looked like this:
Code::Blocks -> notepad++ -> Visual Studio -> VSCode -> Neovim

### Editing
- A few hundred custom keymaps (I am unable to stop myself ;) and... some mousemaps!(°)°)  
- Custom word "speed dial" in normal mode with +/-  
- Easy toggle booleans like true/false yes/no on/off etc...  
- Easy capitalization switching  
- Auto pairing with nvim-autopairs  
- Auto white space trimming on save with custom commands  
- Auto complete with blink.comp  

### Text parsing
supported langauge lua, markdown, yaml, toml  
highlighting: treesitter  
LSP  
custom snippets  

nvim-lint  
spell checking  
conform-nvim  

### file management
- neotree  
- oil  
- telescope  

### ui
lualine with many custom components  
barbar for tabs  
trouble.nvim  
ident-blankline  

### Theme
mostly nightfox with a bunch of custom highlight groups on top  
I am on an B&W eInk monitor so colors must be off for now  

### Plugin management with lazy.nvim
