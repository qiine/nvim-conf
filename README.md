# My fancy config:

Surely overcomplicated

Absolutely not finished

Extremely heretical ;p

My text editor journey looked like this:
Code::Blocks -> notepad++ -> Visual Studio -> VSCode -> Neovim

### Editing
endless custom keymaps and some mousemaps ;)  
custom word "speed dial" in normal mode with +/-  
easy toggle booleans like true/false yes/no on/off etc...  
easy capitalization switching  
auto pairing with nvim-autopairs  
auto white space trimming on save with custom commands  
auto complete with blink.comp  

### Text parsing
supported langauge lua, markdown, yaml, toml  
highlighting: treesitter  
LSP  
custom snippets  

nvim-lint  
spell checking  
conform-nvim  

### file management
neotree
oil
telescope

### ui
lualine with many custom components
barbar for tabs
trouble.nvim
ident-blankline

### Theme
mostly nightfox with a bunch of custom highlight groups on top
I am on an B&W eInk monitor so colors must be off for now

### Plugin management with lazy.nvim
